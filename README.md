![alt text](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Experimental-red.svg)
Hades Flatrock is an experimental, small form-factor (SFF) VR headset that runs on the open-source HadesVR driver.

[WARNING]
This is an EXPERIMENTAL project.
The files and information in this repository are for development and archival purposes only. This project is not recommended for assembly or use in its current state. Proceed at your own risk.
Specifications
Displays: 2x SeeYa 1.03" Micro-OLED Displays
Optics: Pancake Optics (accompanying the SeeYa displays)
Tracking: Modified Arpara Tracker (torn down, re-flashed as a "null" device, and used as a SteamVR tracking override).

Performance Modes
The headset's performance depends on the firmware flashed to the display driver board.
High Refresh Rate Mode: 1920x1920 per eye @ 90Hz
High Resolution Mode: 2560x2560 per eye @ 60Hz

Bill of Materials:
This is not an exhaustive list. A precise BOM will be created in the future.

Core Components:
1x Pair of SeeYa 1.03" 2560x2560 Micro-OLED displays with driver board and matching optical assembly
1x Arpara Tracker
Fasteners & Inserts:
A set of screws harvested from the Arpara Tracker.
A handful of M3 screws (specific lengths to be documented).
A handful of M3x4x5mm heat-set inserts.

This repository currently contains:
/STL: All last-revision STL files for the 3D-printed components of the headset. These files were exported directly from Autodesk Fusion 360.

Current Status & Future Work:
This project is a work in progress.
Final revision STL files have been exported and uploaded.

Acknowledgments
A huge thanks to the HadesVR team for their incredible open-source driver that makes projects like this possible.
Special thanks to DragonSkyRunner, creator of the Hades Widebody, whose headset inspired the use of the Arpara tracker in this headset and whose trials and tribulations allowed for a painless setup.
